/**
 * GroupConfirmMemberRemove is answered with only a userId and a furniture count: the reply names neither the group nor the request
 * it belongs to, and the server may not answer at all (the live emulator stays silent for an ordinary member's own leave request).
 * No timing or ordering rule can bind such a reply safely, so the group windows share one outstanding transaction:
 * - while it is unresolved no other consumer may send GroupConfirmRemoveMember;
 * - the first reply for its user resolves it, and only for the window that owns it; the reply of a closed window is retired by the sink;
 * - a confirmation captured from a reply is valid only for the group on screen and the signed-in user it was captured for (isCurrentSession);
 * - there is no timeout, a late reply is never rebound to a later request;
 * - an unanswered request therefore blocks further requests until the session user changes or the connection is lost: the sink drops the
 *   transaction when the connection is no longer authenticated, so a request sent on the old socket can neither block the new one nor be
 *   answered for it, and a confirmation shown before the loss is no longer valid (isCurrentSession compares the connection epoch).
